    "### Abstract\n",
    " * Police shootings is something that we all see in the news very regularly now.\n",
    " * We have previously analyzed how police shootings differ between races. According to our analysis Black people are being disproportionately killed by Police than other races. This has risen a Black Lives Matter Movement around the country. Why wouldn't you support the Black Lives Movement? I mean it is a good cause, right? However, there are many around the country that argue saying all lives matter or blue lives matter. We will be analyzing how people feel by using Twitter API to do a sentiment analysis on this issue.\n",
    " * In the first section the report will go over how the data was obtained for the analysis\n",
    " * In the second section the report will go over the data analysis\n",
    " * Finally, in the last section the report will go over the conclusions that came about from this analysis answering our research questions.\n"

    "### Obtaining Data\n",
    " * The data we will be using was obtaining from Twitter\n",
    " * In order to get Data from Twitter we needed to use API.\n",
    " * To use the Twitter API you would need to have an:\n",
    " \n",
    "     * API Key\n",
    "     \n",
    "     * API Secret Key\n",
    "     \n",
    "     * Access Token\n",
    "     \n",
    "     * Access Token Secret\n",
    "     \n",
    "   You can obtaining by first creating a Twitter account and then heading over to [Twitter Developer] (https://developer.twitter.com/en) and signing in. Once you sign it you would have to fill out some uestions before you are given your uniue keys.\n",
    "   \n",
    " * Now that you have your unie keys we would have to install and import tweepy.\n",
